    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the
          grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
          occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on
          paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning together in
          a large bowl; do not overmix. Form into 4 patties. Make a thumbprint
          in the middle of each patty to keep it from shrinking as it cooks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Grill patties on the preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6
          minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
          should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top each burger
          with 2 slices bacon and a Cheddar cheese slice; close the grill lid
          until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Remove patties from the grill.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place buns on the grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned,
          about 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Place 1 patty on the bottom
          half of each bun.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack
          eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is
          still runny, about 4 minutes. Immediately place 1 egg on top of each
          patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
